# TIPS TO BECOME A GAME DEVELOPER:
1) ACTUALLY THEY ARE 10 TYPES IN GAME DEVELOPER,
  *GAME DEVELOPER.
  *GAME DESIGNER.
  *GAMEPLAY.
  *PROGRAMMER.
  *ART DESIGNER.
  *CHARACTER ANIMATER.
  *GAME TESTER.
  *GAME MODELLER.
  *LEVEL DESIGNER.
  *SCRIPT WRITER.
  # LEARN PROGRAMMING...
  2)THEY ARE MANY CERTAIN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES TO LEARN TO CREATE ANY GAME:
  (*C,C#,C++,JAVA,JAVA SCRIPT,HTMI,PYTHON AND MANY MORE.*)
  # WHY I RECOMMAND C#/C++...
  *("SOME PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE OUR LIFE EASIER")
  *(OTHER OBJECTS DONT HAVE ALL THE OBJECTS ORIENTED CONCEPTS THAT ARE REQUIRED.)
  *(C# AND C++ ALLOW US TO MAKE CROSS PLATFORM GAMES.)
  *(CROSS PLATFROM GAMES MEANS WHERE WE CAN PLAY IN ANDROID,IOS,PC AND IN OTHER PLATFORMS.)
  # WHAT IS GAME DESIGNER AND GAME DEVELOPER
 Game design deals with the conceptual side of things. Designers come up with the initial vision for a game. The mechanics, the core concepts, the aesthetics, the characters, levels, narratives–these elements tend to fall under the scope of game design.
Game development involves bringing these ideas to life. Developers take games from the conceptual phase, through development, and into reality.

  # STAGE OF DEVELOPING GAMES
  
  Well, it starts from nothing, . You need to make sure that you have a reliable team of artists, programmers, and more.
 Here are the following stages of game development, and the best ways of learning game development
 (step by step).
*Step 1: High ConceptThe first major step in how to develop a game is the high concept. This is a general idea. It’s a very brief description where you try to distill your ideas down to a few sentences

*Step 2: PitchThis is the big one. You pitch your idea in a summarized form to best communicate ideas and their goals. It’s also a time to promote why it would be a prudent idea to develop financially and commercially.

*Step 3: ConceptFurther along, this is the lovechild between the high concept and pitch. This is where you outline and describe all of the aspects of the game. We’re talking story, demographics, risk analysis and a boatload of further information.

*Step 4: Game Design DocumentThis document includes aspects tied to actual gameplay and may include prototypical aspects of your project.

*Step 5: PrototypeThis is where you and your team can shine early on. Building the prototype will allow you to develop the methods in which you’ll fully execute your idea. It’s a good way to build a proof of concept, adapting your goals into a more tangible form.

 # Programming
 
 Things like sound and early graphical assets begin to be implemented. The game is lifted off of the ground and finally starts to take shape. This is where programming comes into the game development process.

Best Programming Languages is the language of game development. Game developers should learn game programming using one of the several coding languages to better their product. But the real question here for some  game developers is how to learn video game programming.

Game developers can learn video game programming using a multitude of different ways. 

Programming Languages The most popular and most  used programming languages currently are:

C++: This is a gaming standard. It’s moderately more difficult than other languages like Java, but it allows for more autonomy and freedom when it comes to design.

Java: Java is one of the most versatile programming languages ever made. It has been proven to run on nearly everything available, making it a favorite for many game developers throughout the years. The versatility is very attractive and could help you along with your project.

HTML: is a markup language used to customize the function and appearance of web pages.

JavaScript: A web-programming language used to create effects within a web browser.

When it comes right down to it, these are merely the different avenues you can take when programming your game.
